    <p>Oh my god, I am so sorry. Is there any help I can get you, or is there anything you want to talk through? Again I apologize, I didn’t mean to offend you or make you feel that way. Really, I didn’t mean that. God, I’m such a white supremacist. Please, excuse me, I’m genuinely trying my hardest to learn here. I promise that I will never, NEVER make that mistake again. Is there any way that I can make it up to you? Please? I’m really terribly sorry if I seem patronizing or ableist here in any way, I’m really just trying to atone. God, I shouldn’t have said that. Please, I want you to believe that I’m trying to be kind here. I’m failing, I’m really sorry. Here, if you don’t want me to make it up to you because you think that I am being offensive in any manner here, please just say so. But please, rest assured that I will do anything and everything to help you after I did something so awful. Oh no, unless of course you don’t need my help, I’m really not invalidating you here you’re a strong and independent person that can make decisions of their own volition. Oh god, if you really wanted help I promise I wasn’t trying to say anything bad just there. If you want help, you can have it. This totally came out the wrong way. God, I am so terrible.</p>
